### Evaluation of the FAO/WHO GIFT Dashboard Based on the 4-E Principles

#### **Evidence**

1. **Platform Goals and Scope: Clarity of Purpose**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The dashboard clearly states its purpose: to provide harmonized data on individual food consumption to support decision-making in nutrition and food safety. This is evident from the "About" section and the introductory text on the homepage. However, the purpose could be more prominently displayed for first-time users.  

2. **Platform Goals and Scope: Measurement of the Outcome**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides metrics such as the number of datasets available (52 datasets from 31 countries) and summary statistics. While these are relevant, the success metrics could be more explicitly tied to the stated goals, such as how the data has influenced policy decisions.  

3. **Platform Goals and Scope: Relevance of Information**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The data and information provided are highly relevant to the stated goals, with detailed descriptions of dietary diversity, environmental impacts, and advanced analysis. The inclusion of publications and news further supports the platform's objectives.  

4. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Source Documentation**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides links to data sources and methodologies, as seen in the "Methodology" section. However, more detailed documentation on data collection processes and links to raw data could improve transparency.  

5. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Scope**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   The dashboard mentions the geographical and temporal scope of the data but does not provide detailed information on sampling design or population representativeness.  

6. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Collection Methodology**  
   **Score: 7/10**  
   While the methodology section provides some insights, it lacks detailed descriptions of data collection methods (e.g., surveys, statistical models).  

7. **Data Quality: Standardization: Comparability Across Dimensions**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard allows for comparisons across countries and time periods. However, the granularity of these comparisons could be improved.  

8. **Data Quality: Standardization: Measurement and Calibration**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   Units and measurements are consistent, but more detailed calibration methods could be provided.  

9. **Data Quality: Standardization: Geospatial Granularity**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides data at national and sub-national levels, but finer granularity (e.g., city-level data) is not consistently available.  

10. **Data Quality: Standardization: Temporal Granularity**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    Temporal granularity is provided (e.g., start and end years of surveys), but the ability to drill down into finer temporal details is limited.  

11. **Data Quality: Granularity: Geospatial Levels**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    The dashboard allows for sub-national data exploration but could benefit from more detailed geospatial subdivisions.  

12. **Data Quality: Granularity: Temporal Levels**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    Temporal data is available but lacks the ability to explore trends within shorter timeframes (e.g., monthly or quarterly).  

13. **Data Quality: Granularity: Demographic Stratification**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    The dashboard provides some demographic breakdowns (e.g., women aged 15-49), but more stratifications (e.g., income, education) would enhance usability.  

14. **Data Quality: Granularity: Nutrition Aspects**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    The dashboard includes data on dietary diversity and food groups but could expand to include more specific nutrients.  

15. **Data Quality: Completeness: Missing Data Denotation**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    Missing data is not consistently labeled or quantified, which could lead to confusion.  

16. **Data Quality: Completeness: Explanation of Missing Data**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The dashboard does not provide explicit explanations for missing data.  

17. **Data Quality: Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The percentage of missing data is not quantified, which limits transparency.
