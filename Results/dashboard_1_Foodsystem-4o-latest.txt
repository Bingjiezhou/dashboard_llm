#### **Evidence: Platform Goals and Scope**

1. **Clarity of Purpose (Score: 9)**  
   The dashboard clearly states its purpose: to provide a comprehensive view of food systems by integrating data from multiple sources. This is evident in the "About the Food Systems Dashboard" section and the homepage. However, the purpose could be further emphasized with a concise mission statement on every page.

2. **Measurement of the Outcome (Score: 8)**  
   The dashboard defines success through its ability to provide actionable insights and track progress using indicators. However, the metrics for success (e.g., user engagement or policy impact) are not explicitly stated.

3. **Relevance of Information (Score: 9)**  
   The data and indicators align well with the stated goals of understanding food systems. The inclusion of global, national, and subnational data supports this. However, some indicators lack detailed justification for their inclusion.

#### **Evidence: Data Quality**

4. **Transparency: Data Source Documentation (Score: 10)**  
   Data sources are well-documented, with metadata and references provided for each indicator. For example, the Nigeria map includes a clear citation of the data source.

5. **Transparency: Data Scope (Score: 9)**  
   The dashboard provides information on population coverage, timeframe, and sampling design. However, some datasets lack detailed descriptions of representativeness.

6. **Transparency: Data Collection Methodology (Score: 8)**  
   While the dashboard mentions data collection methods in the metadata, it does not consistently provide detailed methodologies for all indicators.

7. **Standardization: Comparability Across Dimensions (Score: 9)**  
   The dashboard allows comparisons across time, geography, and indicators. However, some indicators lack clear units or calibration methods.

8. **Standardization: Measurement Units (Score: 8)**  
   Units are generally clear, but some visualizations (e.g., affordability of a healthy diet) could benefit from more explicit labeling.

9. **Standardization: Geospatial Granularity (Score: 9)**  
   The dashboard supports global, national, and subnational views, as seen in the country dashboards. However, granularity is inconsistent across countries.

10. **Standardization: Temporal Granularity (Score: 9)**  
   Temporal data is available for most indicators, with a timeline feature. However, some datasets lack recent updates.

11. **Granularity: Geospatial Levels (Score: 9)**  
   Users can drill down to subnational levels for countries like Nigeria and Bangladesh. However, this feature is not available for all countries.

12. **Granularity: Temporal Levels (Score: 8)**  
   Temporal granularity is good, but the ability to drill down into finer time intervals (e.g., monthly data) is limited.

13. **Granularity: Demographic Variables (Score: 7)**  
   The dashboard provides limited stratification by demographic variables like age or gender.

14. **Granularity: Nutrition Aspects (Score: 8)**  
   The dashboard includes various nutrition-related indicators but could expand on specific nutrients or dietary patterns.

15. **Completeness: Missing Data Labels (Score: 9)**  
   Missing data is labeled as "No Data" or "Not Available," ensuring clarity.

16. **Completeness: Explanation of Missing Data (Score: 8)**  
   While missing data is acknowledged, explanations for why data is missing are not consistently provided.

17. **Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data (Score: 7)**  
   The dashboard does not quantify the extent of missing data for each variable.

#### **Efficiency: Platform Capability**

18. **Data Portal (Score: 10)**  
   The dashboard allows users to explore, review, and download data in multiple formats, as seen in the "Download Data" section.

19. **Tutorial (Score: 8)**  
   The "About the Dashboard" section provides guidance, but an interactive tutorial or video walkthrough would enhance usability.

20. **Reference Material (Score: 10)**  
   Comprehensive reference materials, including publications and methodologies, are provided.

21. **Flexibility to Incorporate More Data (Score: 9)**  
   The dashboard appears scalable, but this is not explicitly stated.

22. **Last Updated Date (Score: 10)**  
   The last updated date is clearly displayed in the "Download Data" section.

#### **Efficiency: Visualization Quality**

23. **Readability: Adequate Visualizations (Score: 9)**  
   Visualizations are clear and effectively demonstrate data trends. However, some maps could benefit from additional annotations.

24. **Readability: Description of Visualizations (Score: 8)**  
   Descriptions are provided but could be more detailed for complex visualizations.

25. **Readability: Titles, Labels, and Legends (Score: 9)**  
   Titles and labels are clear, but some legends (e.g., color scales) could be more intuitive.

26. **Readability: Color Usage (Score: 9)**  
   Colors are used effectively, but accessibility for colorblind users could be improved.

27. **Readability: Accessible Color Schemes (Score: 8)**  
   While generally good, some color schemes may not be fully accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.

28. **Readability: High Resolution (Score: 10)**  
   Visualizations are available in high resolution.

29. **Interactivity: Tooltips, Zooming, Scrolling (Score: 9)**

   Dropdown menus allow users to select indicators and categories easily.

31. **Interactivity: Dropdown Menus for Subpopulations (Score: 8)**  
   Subpopulation filters are limited, reducing the ability to explore data for specific groups.

32. **Visualization Download Option (Score: 9)**  
   Visualizations can be downloaded, but customization options (e.g., applied filters) are limited.
