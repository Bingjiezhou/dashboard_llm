### Evaluation of the Dashboard Based on the 4-E Principles

#### **Evidence**

1. **Platform Goals and Scope: Clarity of Purpose**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The dashboard clearly states its purpose: to provide nutrition and health-related data for countries. The inclusion of country-specific profiles, global monitoring frameworks, and data search functionality supports this goal. However, the purpose could be more explicitly stated in a dedicated section.  

2. **Platform Goals and Scope: Measurement of the Outcome**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides relevant metrics (e.g., stunting, anemia, and breastfeeding rates) to measure progress toward global nutrition goals. However, the connection between these metrics and the stated goals could be more explicitly explained.  

3. **Platform Goals and Scope: Relevance of Information**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The data presented (e.g., malnutrition rates, health services, and food security) is highly relevant to the goals of monitoring nutrition and health. The inclusion of multiple indicators and their sources enhances credibility.  

4. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Source Documentation**  
   **Score: 10/10**  
   Each indicator is accompanied by a source link, ensuring transparency. This is a best practice in data presentation.

   **Score: 7/10**  
   While data sources are cited, the methodology for data collection (e.g., surveys, statistical models) is not consistently detailed.  

7. **Data Quality: Standardization: Comparability Across Dimensions**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The dashboard allows for temporal and spatial comparisons, as seen in the time-series graphs and country-specific data.  

8. **Data Quality: Standardization: Measurement and Calibration**

10. **Data Quality: Standardization: Temporal Granularity**  
    **Score: 9/10**  
    Data is available for multiple years, allowing for temporal analysis.  

11. **Data Quality: Granularity: Geospatial Levels**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The dashboard does not allow for drill-down into finer geographical subdivisions.  

12. **Data Quality: Granularity: Temporal Levels**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    Temporal data is available for multiple years, but finer granularity (e.g., monthly data) is not provided.  

13. **Data Quality: Granularity: Demographic Stratification**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    Some indicators are stratified by age and sex, but other demographic variables (e.g., income, education) are not consistently included.  

14. **Data Quality: Granularity: Nutrition Aspects**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    The dashboard includes data on specific nutrition aspects (e.g., breastfeeding, vitamin deficiencies), but more detailed breakdowns (e.g., individual food items) are missing.  

15. **Data Quality: Completeness: Missing Data Labels**  
    **Score: 9/10**  
    Missing data is clearly labeled as "No data" or "Doesn't meet."  

16. **Data Quality: Completeness: Explanation for Missing Data**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The dashboard does not provide explicit explanations for missing data.  

17. **Data Quality: Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The percentage of missing data is not quantified.
