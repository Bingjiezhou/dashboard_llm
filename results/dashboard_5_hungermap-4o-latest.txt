### Evaluation of the HungerMap Dashboard Based on the 4-E Principles

#### **Evidence**

1. **Platform Goals and Scope: Clarity of Purpose**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The dashboard clearly states its purpose in the "About HungerMap" section, which is to monitor global hunger in real-time using various data sources. The goal is well-defined and aligns with the World Food Programme's mission. However, the purpose could be emphasized more prominently on the homepage for first-time users.  

2. **Platform Goals and Scope: Measurement of the Outcome**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides metrics such as the prevalence of insufficient food consumption and malnutrition rates. These are relevant and easy to understand. However, some metrics (e.g., chronic malnutrition) lack data, which limits the ability to measure outcomes comprehensively.  

3. **Platform Goals and Scope: Relevance of Information**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The data presented (e.g., food security trends, macroeconomic indicators) is highly relevant to the stated goals. The inclusion of conflict and climate alerts adds depth. However, the lack of data in some areas (e.g., nutrition) slightly detracts from the overall relevance.  

4. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Source Documentation**  
   **Score: 10/10**  
   The glossary and methodology sections provide detailed information about data sources, including their names, update frequency, and scope. This ensures transparency and credibility.  

5. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Scope**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The dashboard covers 94 countries and provides real-time updates. However, the representativeness of the data for certain regions or populations is not explicitly discussed.  

6. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Collection Methodology**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   The methodology section explains the use of machine learning models and real-time monitoring. While this is commendable, more details on specific data collection methods (e.g., surveys or satellite data) would enhance clarity.  

7. **Data Quality: Standardization: Comparability Across Dimensions**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard allows for temporal and spatial comparisons. However, the lack of data for some indicators (e.g., chronic malnutrition) limits comprehensive comparisons.  

8. **Data Quality: Standardization: Measurement Units**  
   **Score: 9/10**  
   Measurement units (e.g., percentages for food insecurity) are clearly provided and consistent.  

9. **Data Quality: Standardization: Geospatial Granularity**  
   **Score: 8/10**  
   The dashboard provides data at global, national, and subnational levels. However, finer granularity (e.g., city-level data) is not available.  

10. **Data Quality: Standardization: Temporal Granularity**  
    **Score: 9/10**  
    Data is updated in real-time, and trends are shown over months. This is sufficient for most use cases.  

11. **Data Quality: Granularity: Geospatial Levels**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    Users can drill down to subnational levels, but the granularity could be improved further.  

12. **Data Quality: Granularity: Temporal Levels**  
    **Score: 9/10**  
    Temporal trends are well-represented, with options to view data over time.  

13. **Data Quality: Granularity: Demographic Stratification**  
    **Score: 6/10**  
    The dashboard does not provide demographic breakdowns (e.g., by age or gender), which limits its utility for targeted interventions.  

14. **Data Quality: Granularity: Nutrition Aspects**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    While the dashboard includes some nutrition indicators, the lack of data for chronic and acute malnutrition is a significant limitation.  

15. **Data Quality: Completeness: Missing Data Labels**  
    **Score: 9/10**  
    Missing data is clearly labeled as "No Data," ensuring transparency.  

16. **Data Quality: Completeness: Explanation for Missing Data**  
    **Score: 8/10**  
    The methodology section explains the use of predictive models when data is unavailable. However, more explicit reasons for missing data would be helpful.  

17. **Data Quality: Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data**  
    **Score: 7/10**  
    The dashboard does not quantify the extent of missing data, which would provide additional context.
