### Evaluation of the Dashboard Based on the 4-E Principles

#### **Evidence**

1. **Platform Goals and Scope: Clarity of Purpose**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Justification**: The dashboard clearly states its purpose of providing a platform for coordinated data sharing and improving data quality for acute malnutrition. The "About Us" section explicitly outlines the goals, such as identifying data gaps and supporting evidence-based programs. However, the purpose could be emphasized more prominently on the homepage.

2. **Platform Goals and Scope: Measurement of the Outcome**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Justification**: The dashboard provides metrics such as prevalence, incidence, and coverage of malnutrition, as seen in the "Global" section. However, it lacks a clear explanation of how these metrics are used to measure progress toward the stated goals.

3. **Platform Goals and Scope: Relevance of Information**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Justification**: The information provided, such as case studies, research documents, and tools, is highly relevant to the goals of addressing acute malnutrition. The inclusion of COVID-19 adaptations further enhances its relevance.

4. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Source Documentation**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Justification**: Data sources are mentioned (e.g., UNICEF NutriDash), but detailed documentation or links to raw data are not consistently provided.

5. **Data Quality: Transparency: Data Scope**

7. **Data Quality: Standardization: Comparability**
   - **Score: 8/10**
   - **Justification**: The dashboard allows for temporal and spatial comparisons, as seen in the "Global" section. However, the granularity of comparisons could be improved.

8. **Data Quality: Standardization: Measurement Units**
   - **Score: 9/10**
   - **Justification**: Measurement units (e.g., percentages for prevalence) are clearly provided and consistent across visualizations.

9. **Data Quality: Standardization: Geospatial Granularity**
   - **Score: 8/10**

10. **Data Quality: Standardization: Temporal Granularity**
    - **Score: 8/10**
    - **Justification**: Data is available for multiple years, but the ability to drill down to finer temporal levels (e.g., monthly data) is limited.

11. **Data Quality: Granularity: Geospatial Levels**
    - **Score: 7/10**
    - **Justification**: The dashboard allows for national and subnational views but does not provide detailed drill-down capabilities.

12. **Data Quality: Granularity: Temporal Levels**
    - **Score: 7/10**
    - **Justification**: Temporal data is available but lacks the ability to explore trends at a more granular level.

13. **Data Quality: Granularity: Demographic Stratification**
    - **Score: 6/10**
    - **Justification**: The dashboard does not provide options to stratify data by demographic variables such as age, sex, or income.

14. **Data Quality: Granularity: Nutrition Aspects**
    - **Score: 7/10**
    - **Justification**: The dashboard includes data on malnutrition prevalence and treatment but does not break it down into specific nutrition aspects like dietary patterns.

15. **Data Quality: Completeness: Missing Data Labels**
    - **Score: 8/10**
    - **Justification**: Missing data is not explicitly labeled, but the dashboard does not appear to have significant gaps in the presented data.

16. **Data Quality: Completeness: Explanation of Missing Data**
    - **Score: 6/10**
    - **Justification**: There is no explicit explanation for missing data in the dashboard.

17. **Data Quality: Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data**
    - **Score: 5/10**
    - **Justification**: The dashboard does not quantify or present the percentage of missing data for variables.
