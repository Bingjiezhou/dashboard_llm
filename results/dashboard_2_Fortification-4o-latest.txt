---

### **Evidence**

#### **Platform Goals and Scope**
1. **Clarity of Purpose**: **9/10**  
   - The dashboard clearly states its purpose of providing actionable food fortification data. The introductory page and "About" section explain the goals effectively. However, the purpose could be emphasized more prominently on the homepage.

2. **Measurement of the Outcome**: **8/10**  
   - The dashboard provides metrics such as food availability, fortification coverage, and compliance. These are relevant and measurable. However, the connection between these metrics and the stated goals could be more explicitly defined.

3. **Relevance of Information**: **9/10**  
   - The data and visualizations are highly relevant to the goals of tracking and improving food fortification. The inclusion of country-specific dashboards and global comparisons supports this.

#### **Data Quality**
4. **Transparency: Data Source Documentation**: **10/10**  
   - Data sources are well-documented in the "Methods and Sources" section, with clear citations and references.

5. **Transparency: Data Scope**: **9/10**  
   - The dashboard provides information on population coverage, timeframe, and sampling design. However, some datasets lack detailed descriptions of representativeness.

6. **Transparency: Data Collection Methodology**: **9/10**  
   - The methodology section explains data collection methods, but more details on statistical models or survey designs could enhance transparency.

7. **Standardization: Comparability Across Dimensions**: **10/10**  
   - The dashboard allows comparisons across time, geography, and indicators, with filters for income status, region, and food vehicles.

8. **Standardization: Measurement Units**: **10/10**  
   - Units are clearly defined and consistent across visualizations, such as grams per capita per day or percentages.

9. **Standardization: Geospatial Granularity**: **9/10**  
   - Data can be viewed at global, regional, and national levels. However, finer granularity (e.g., subnational data) is not available.

10. **Standardization: Temporal Granularity**: **9/10**  
    - Data can be analyzed by year, but more granular options (e.g., monthly or quarterly) are not provided.

11. **Granularity: Geospatial Levels**: **8/10**  
    - The dashboard allows drill-downs to country-level data but lacks subnational granularity.

12. **Granularity: Temporal Levels**: **8/10**  
    - Temporal drill-downs are limited to annual data.

13. **Granularity: Demographic Variables**: **7/10**  
    - Limited demographic stratification (e.g., age, sex) is available. Adding these would improve usability.

14. **Granularity: Nutrition Aspects**: **9/10**  
    - The dashboard provides data on nutrients, food vehicles, and dietary patterns, but more detailed breakdowns (e.g., specific food items) could be included.

15. **Completeness: Missing Data Labels**: **10/10**  
    - Missing data are clearly labeled as "Not available" or "Unknown."

16. **Completeness: Explanation of Missing Data**: **9/10**  
    - Missing data are explained in the methodology section, but more detailed reasons for gaps could be provided.

17. **Completeness: Quantification of Missing Data**: **8/10**  
    - The dashboard quantifies missing data but does not always provide percentages.

    - The last updated date is prominently displayed on each page.

#### **Visualization Quality**
23. **Readability: Adequacy of Visualizations**: **9/10**  
    - Visualizations are clear and effectively demonstrate data trends. However, some charts could benefit from additional annotations.

24. **Readability: Description of Visualizations**: **9/10**  
    - Each visualization includes a description, but some could provide more context.

25. **Readability: Titles, Labels, and Legends**: **10/10**  
    - Titles, axis labels, and legends are clear and well-structured.

26. **Readability: Color Representation**: **9/10**  
    - Colors are logical and distinguishable, but accessibility for colorblind users could be improved.

27. **Readability: Accessibility of Color Schemes**: **8/10**  
    - While generally accessible, some color schemes may not be fully optimized for users with color vision deficiencies.

28. **Readability: Resolution**: **10/10**  
    - Visualizations are high-resolution and easy to interpret.

29. **Interactivity: Tooltips, Zooming, and Scrolling**: **9/10**  
    - Interactive features like tooltips and zooming are available but could be more intuitive.

30. **Interactivity: Dropdown Menus for Data Selection**: **10/10**  
    - Dropdown menus allow users to filter data by multiple indicators and categories.

31. **Interactivity: Dropdown Menus for Detail Levels**: **9/10**  
    - Filters for region, income status, and legislation status are available, but demographic filters are limited.

32. **Visualization Download Options**: **10/10**  
    - Visualizations can be downloaded with applied filters.
