It includes actions which can directly shift food systems towards increasing the availability, affordability, appeal/acceptability of high quality, safe, nutritious foods in food environments, and away from nutrient-poor refined foods, products high in sugars, fats, and/or salt (e.g. fried foods sold by street vendors) and pre-packaged “ultra-processed” snacks."

        "text": "The scope of potential action in food systems is large. Food systems include a huge amount of activity related to producing, processing, distributing, preparing and consuming food. The actions here represent a wide scope of possible food system solutions across production, supply chain, food environments and consumers. To set boundaries, and to emphasise how actions can have direct impact on healthy diets, actions were limited to those with a clear pathway to impact on availability, affordability, appeal/acceptability and safety. For this reason, actions on broader principles, governance and political processes were out of scope.For more detail on how the actions were identified, read our methods."
      },
      {
        "text": "Below are 45 actions which can be taken to re-orient food systems towards environmental sustainability. The actions include those with potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of food systems, improve the positive impact, or both, across five environmental dimensions: GHG emissions, chemical pollution, freshwater resources, biodiversity, and soil health. For each action there is a clear and direct pathway to impact on one or more of these five environmental dimensions. Each action is accompanied by an assessment of trade-offs — defined as negative effects across any dimension — that could result from implementing the action, and of potential co-benefits for nutrition alongside environmental outcomes. We organized the actions into five groups, based on their domain: actions to reorient land use in agriculture, actions to improve the environmental impact of agriculture and farming, actions to improve the sustainability of wild fisheries and aquaculture, actions to reduce food loss and waste, and actions to reorient diets and overall food demand. There is no hierarchy to how groups or actions are presented, but closely related actions are displayed in proximity within groups."
      },
      {
        "text": "The potential for action is large because food systems stretch across several domains of human activity — from land use to consumer diets — impacting the environment at each point along the way. Therefore, the actions are broad in scope and would operate across different scales. For example, actions to reorient land use in agriculture aim to drive macro-level changes in how land is used for food production across the globe, through a combination of public and private action. Some of the actions to reorient diets and overall food demand instead take a more micro-level approach, and aim to incentivise people to transition to more sustainable diets by combining regulatory interventions with improved access to information on the environmental impacts of certain foods."
      },
      {
        "text": "While illustrating the potential for substantial improvements in the sustainability of food systems, we also use the list as an opportunity to show that almost all actions, at least 42 out of 45, could potentially generate trade-offs across several dimensions. Not to be taken as a deterministic assessment of what would certainly happen if a specific action is implemented, the trade-offs in our list provide a reminder to policymakers that successful efforts to make food systems more environmentally sustainable could negatively impact certain stakeholders. But many of the actions could also generate positive additional impacts: in the list, alongside trade-offs, we included potential co-benefits between environmental and dietary goals, to show how improving the sustainability of food systems could also lead to better diets. We only included potential co-benefits for which we were able to develop a clear pathway to impact. The co-benefits show that synergies will likely not emerge spontaneously: policymakers and stakeholders will largely need to explicitly aim to incorporate both environmental and nutritional outcomes from the start when designing a policy, or combine multiple policies. By combining the actions, co-benefits, and trade-offs, we make a strong case for applying broad thinking and a flexible approach to improving food systems, showing that the potential consequences of achieving change matter as much as the goals that are driving it."
