        "text": "Dashboards are useful tools that visualize key information and facilitate understanding for complex systems. They present data from multiple, diverse sources into simple, visually appealing graphics. This allows stakeholders to set priorities for action and track progress to see if policies or other interventions are working. However, the effectiveness of dashboards can be limited if they only provide data without any deeper analysis. In recent years, the public health and nutrition communities have used dashboards to track the progress of health goals and interventions, including the Sustainable Development Goals. To our knowledge, the Food Systems Dashboard (FSD) is the first that brings together country-level data across all components of the food system and provides deeper analysis and guidance on how to use this data in meaningful ways."

These indicators come from over 40 sources, both public and private, including United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research (CGIAR), Euromonitor International, and cross-country project-based datasets. The FSD is continually being updated to include new indicators, growing from around 140 indicators when first launched in 2020 to around 300 today."
