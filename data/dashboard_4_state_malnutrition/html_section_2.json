By sharing these experiences, it is expected that other national, regional and global-level stakeholders can better understand, support and learn from their experience. Panellists from UNICEF and FHI360 explained that the process to develop the simplified approaches SOP for use in exceptional circumstances was new in both countries; even though there were some delays and bumps in the road along the development process, as well as some refinement still expected, they were eager to continue learning as they are operationalized and excited to share more in-depth insights with stakeholders moving forward."
