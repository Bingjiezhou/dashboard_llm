In 2019, a guidance note was issuedto enable the use of RUTF for children with severe and moderate acute malnutrition duringemergencies. In 2023, approximately 160,000 children were estimated to suffer from wasting,including an estimated 19,775 children who needed life-saving treatment for severe wasting.Due to a lack of investment for essential nutrition supplies and quality improvement, only10,556 children with severe wasting were treated, which represented the lowest admissionrate recorded over the course of the last 7 years. As information about treatment coverage isscarce, a coverage assessment was deemed necessary to assess the IMAM programme accessand to identify the barriers and boosters of access to treatment in Zimbabwe.This coverage survey consisted of an analysis of routine programme monitoring data at thelevel of provinces and/or districts, which was integrated into a bottleneck analysis to identifyhigh and low performing provinces and/or districts. In the second stage, a series of SLEACsurveys was conducted across the selected high and low performing districts to classifycoverage, identify key barriers and boosters of access and coverage from the communityperspective. In the third stage, an in-depth qualitative inquiry was conducted to further deepenthe understanding of identified barriers and boosters in Stage 1 and 2 and to formulatemeaningful recommendations adapted to the context."
