        "text": "This case study is part of a compendium of country-level case studies produced by the Delivery System for Scale (DSFS) project that explore promising, context-specific approaches to scale the management of wasting treatment for children under five. In Kenya, UNICEF and partners supported Government to develop a novel approach to synthesize results across 18 different semi-quantitative evaluation of access and coverage (SQUEAC) surveys. The approach is believed to provide a new and unique means of not only consolidating lessons learned from these survey areas, but importantly, clarifying common issues across survey areas that could benefit from national-level planning and coordination so as to better support local authorities in their journey to expand coverage of child wasting treatment. This case study, therefore, outlines the approach and primary findings of SQUEAC synthesis, as well as implications for national-level nutrition coordination groups moving forward."
