In rural areas in low-middle income countries (LMICs), people frequently live closely with their livestock – usually sharing living and sleeping quarters. Animals therefore carry faeces and their pathogens into the immediate area where infants live and play (XV). Infants are often put down on the floor to play, and during exploration and crawling, infants often directly ingest faeces from contaminated floors and indirectly ingest faeces from dirty hands, toys and other objects (XVI, (XVII). Research shows associations between animal proximity, early infant infection and undernutrition (XVIII-XIX). The fact that WaSH interventions don’t usually try to separate animals from living environments may be one reason why interventions have largely not reduced diarrhoea incidence or significantly improved undernutrition."

Other secondary outcomes included effects on infant health* (change in pathogen infection and diarrhoea prevalence), infant injury prevention and effects on maternal time, stress and work burden. The trial  took place in Sidama Zone, SNNPR. 100 households were randomly allocated to the intervention arm (they received a HPS) or to control (no HPS, but received one following the trial).

However, interventions must also consider the many pathways to infant infection – including incorrectly (re-)heated foods, contaminated water and hands – if we are to address diarrhoea and SAM. This means ensuring communities, especially women, are technically supported to develop their own interventions to block infection risk pathways. This can be enabled through stepping up investments and allowing mothers and caregivers to take a central role in decision-making."

  "other infornation": "Guts, germs and growth: Infant infection, malnutrition and WaSH\nHalf a million children\nstill die annually from diarrhoea. Although in recent years diarrhoeal mortality has lowered (I), diarrhoeal prevalence has not reduced: before age two, infants may experience up to eight episodes a year (II). It has long been recognised that infection underlies the relationship between disease and nutrition. There is a negative, cyclical relationship between nutrition, immunity, infection and undernutrition (III). Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) increases the severity of infectious diseases (e.g. diarrhoea), and mortality in SAM is almost always due to infection (IV). Thus infection prevention is key.\nA large proportion of infant mortality is due to infection from\npoor WaSH\n(water, sanitation and hygiene). The preventative role of WaSH in diarrhoea and undernutrition is well-recognised, and has even reached mainstream news, as recently discussed in a\nGuardian article\n. By design, WaSH interventions should block bacterial transmission and prevent infection. However, whilst evidence shows safe WaSH is associated with increases in height (VI-VIII) and weight (IX), effects on diarrhoea are mixed (IX-XIII).\nThe role of domestic animals in infant infection\nMost death from diarrhoea is caused by only a few pathogens (XV). Many of these are zoonotic – meaning they are transmitted from animals (XV). In rural areas in low-middle income countries (LMICs), people frequently live closely with their livestock – usually sharing living and sleeping quarters. Animals therefore carry faeces and their pathogens into the immediate area where infants live and play (XV). Infants are often put down on the floor to play, and during exploration and crawling, infants often directly ingest faeces from contaminated floors and indirectly ingest faeces from dirty hands, toys and other objects (XVI, (XVII). Research shows associations between animal proximity, early infant infection and undernutrition (XVIII-XIX). The fact that WaSH interventions don’t usually try to separate animals from living environments may be one reason why interventions have largely not reduced diarrhoea incidence or significantly improved undernutrition.\nWaSH interventions: An infant-centred approach\nTo improve infant health, WaSH interventions must be more effectively tailored toward this age group. This means they must consider age and behaviour-related factors which increase infection risk (including crawling, playing and mouthing), and the infection risks from animal faeces as well as human faeces (XV). One intervention component which has been proposed is a household play space (HPS). The\nWHO\ndeem a HPS a ‘critical’ intervention component which might help reduce infection from contaminated floors and objects that become contaminated from faeces.\nThe CAMPI trial: Design\nOur research team consisting of PIN, Cranfield University and Hawassa University, funded by Czech Development Agency, designed and set up the Campylobacter-Associated Malnutrition Playspace Intervention (CAMPI) study. It was a randomised, controlled feasibility trial of a HPS in rural Ethiopia and took place between January-March 2020 (XX). Its main aim was to assess the potential to proceed to a full trial. Other secondary outcomes included effects on infant health* (change in pathogen infection and diarrhoea prevalence), infant injury prevention and effects on maternal time, stress and work burden. The trial  took place in Sidama Zone, SNNPR. 100 households were randomly allocated to the intervention arm (they received a HPS) or to control (no HPS, but received one following the trial). Data were collected at baseline and at two and four weeks (XX).\nThe CAMPI trial: Main findings\nThe trial demonstrated that HPSs are well accepted, used regularly and cleaned well (XX). Reported daily use increased for certain activities, suggesting it became easier to incorporate the HPS into daily life. At four weeks, reported seven-day diarrhoea declined more markedly within the intervention group, who were 43% less likely to experience diarrhoea.\nHowever, from baseline, there was no difference in pathogen infection or no reduced odds between groups.\nAs illustrated, mothers reported many secondary benefits including easing work burden, time restraints, and fears and worries about infant health and safety:\nEmpowerment or increased workload? Key considerations for mothers\nA HPS holds the potential to help improve maternal empowerment through time availability and choice, reducing anxiety over her infant’s wellbeing, health and safety, and even freeing up time for her infant. However, this must be balanced by any negative long-term impacts, including reinforcing women’s roles as sole caregivers alongside a continuing responsibility for other duties. Findings showed that where when the mother had to collect water, the HPS was less likely to be used or cleaned properly. In many LMICs, women’s’\n‘triple work burden’\ncan affect their well-being and may reduce engagement in childcare, affecting\ninfant nutrition\n. This highlights a trade-off in encouraging childcare alongside existing duties, and any intervention must ensure it does not further encumber women.\nThis early data suggests a HPS may help reduce diarrhoea: ultimately, this might contribute a small reduction to the overall infection burden and to undernutrition. However, interventions must also consider the many pathways to infant infection – including incorrectly (re-)heated foods, contaminated water and hands – if we are to address diarrhoea and SAM. This means ensuring communities, especially women, are technically supported to develop their own interventions to block infection risk pathways. This can be enabled through stepping up investments and allowing mothers and caregivers to take a central role in decision-making.\nThe\ntrial is registered\nwith the Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations (RIDIE), study ID: RIDIE-STUDY-ID-5de0b6938afb8.\n*It should be noted that as a feasibility trial, the CAMPI trial was not powered to detect differences in health outcomes and results should be interpreted as such. Health outcomes were secondary.\nReferences\n(I) GBD 2017 Diarrhoeal Disease Collaborators.
