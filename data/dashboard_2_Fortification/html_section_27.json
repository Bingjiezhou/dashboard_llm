Greenhouse gas emissions allow for heat to be trapped in the atmosphere, ultimately leading to increased surface temperatures on earth. Carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) is the most common greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, and atmospheric levels are at an all-time high. CO\n2\nemissions are harmful to the planet, and the potential impacts on human health and nutrition are life threatening.\nClimate change is much more than an environmental issue – it’s a nutrition issue. Studies show that many plants grown under conditions of higher CO\n2\nlevels suffer a decrease in micronutrients including B vitamins, zinc, and iron. Preventing climate change is of utmost importance. When addressing issues brought on by climate change, it’s important that populations don’t become at risk for micronutrient deficiencies. Food fortification can help fill the micronutrient gap that millions of people will be more vulnerable to because of a less diverse diet.\nUseful links:\nHuman-wrought environmental changes impacting crops and pollinators could harm health of millions\nRising temperature and carbon emissions decrease food’s nutrient quality\nAs Carbon Dioxide Levels Rise, Major Crops Are Losing Nutrients\nThe effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] on micronutrient concentration, specifically iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) in rice; a systematic review\nRising atmospheric CO2 increases global threat of zinc deficiency\nImpact of anthropogenic CO2 emissions on global human nutrition\nFortifying Our Food to Fight Climate Change\nEnsuring Nutritious Food Under Elevated CO2 Conditions: A Case for Improved C4 Crops\nThe Potential Impact of Climate Change on the Micronutrient-Rich Food Supply\nBalancing a sustained pursuit of nutrition, health, affordability and climate goals: exploring the case of Indonesia"
