The charts and statistics below help compose a user-friendly visualization for anyone interested in visualizing key metrics such as fortification monitoring protocols, quality, compliance, coverage, and fortification standards. Our data is easily filtered by the micronutrient data map or drop-down filter function in the top-right section of the dashboard.Nutrients in maize flour fortification standards are described in the first section. Here you will also find maize flour fortification coverage, fortification opportunity, and food availability based on the population coverage of maize flour for each country.Oil fortification standards are in the next section, where fortification quality and compliance help us understand how much oil is fortified. Nutrients found in oil include Vitamin D and Vitamin A, while the fortification opportunity of industrial processing indicates the feasibility to fortify such food. The population coverage directly affects the expected benefits from fortification.Rice fortification standards can also be visualized on this dashboard. The fortification legislation status may not be available for all countries, but many will list what nutrients can be found in rice standards. If rice fortification coverage is available, one can conceptualize the fortification opportunity based on its proportion of industrially processed rice and availability.Another important food is salt. The legislation scope for salt includes many types of salt that must be fortified. The presence of monitoring protocols helps external & import production observations become clear. Nutrients in salt fortification may include iodine in milligrams per kilogram of salt.Finally, we have wheat flour as a final category of food fortification on our data visualization dashboard. Voluntary fortification shows a variety of nutrients in wheat flour with some quality and compliance statistics available. The opportunity for wheat flour in these countries may be determinant on the proportion of wheat flour industrially processed.Please feel free to explore the data and interact with the Global Food Fortification Exchange dashboard.

The charts and statistics below help compose a user-friendly visualization for anyone interested in visualizing key metrics such as fortification monitoring protocols, quality, compliance, coverage, and fortification standards. Our data is easily filtered by the micronutrient data map or drop-down filter function in the top-right section of the dashboard.\nNutrients in maize flour fortification standards are described in the first section. Here you will also find maize flour fortification coverage, fortification opportunity, and food availability based on the population coverage of maize flour for each country.\nOil fortification standards are in the next section, where fortification quality and compliance help us understand how much oil is fortified. Nutrients found in oil include Vitamin D and Vitamin A, while the fortification opportunity of industrial processing indicates the feasibility to fortify such food. The population coverage directly affects the expected benefits from fortification.\nRice fortification standards can also be visualized on this dashboard. The fortification legislation status may not be available for all countries, but many will list what nutrients can be found in rice standards. If rice fortification coverage is available, one can conceptualize the fortification opportunity based on its proportion of industrially processed rice and availability.\nAnother important food is salt. The legislation scope for salt includes many types of salt that must be fortified. The presence of monitoring protocols helps external & import production observations become clear. Nutrients in salt fortification may include iodine in milligrams per kilogram of salt.\nFinally, we have wheat flour as a final category of food fortification on our data visualization dashboard. Voluntary fortification shows a variety of nutrients in wheat flour with some quality and compliance statistics available. The opportunity for wheat flour in these countries may be determinant on the proportion of wheat flour industrially processed.\nPlease feel free to explore the data and interact with the Global Food Fortification Exchange dashboard.
