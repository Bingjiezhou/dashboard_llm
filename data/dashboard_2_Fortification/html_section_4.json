Moreover, when fortification is mandatory, no behavior change or even knowledge on the part of the consumer is required; they will benefit simply by continuing to eat the foods they normally buy. Voluntary fortification is undertaken at the discretion of the private sector, although preferably based on standards set by government.

  "other infornation": "INTRODUCTION\nWelcome to the GFDx, an analysis and visualization tool for data on food fortification. Food fortification adds essential vitamins and minerals, called micronutrients, to commonly consumed foods to prevent nutritional deficiencies. We call these commonly consumed foods that can be fortified\nfood vehicles\nbecause they “deliver” nutrients.\nFood fortification is one of the most scalable, sustainable and cost-effective interventions to combat micronutrient malnutrition.\nVitamin and mineral deficiencies affect people globally – impacting their health and limiting their ability to contribute to the economic well-being of their communities and countries.\nDesigned for, and by the fortification community, the GFDx provides all the data necessary to track global progress on food fortification, and to enable decision makers to use data to improve the quality of national fortification programs."
