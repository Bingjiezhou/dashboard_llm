It combines key metrics from various data sources – such as food security information, weather, population size, conflict, hazards, nutrition information and macro-economic data – to help assess, monitor and predict the magnitude and severity of hunger in near real-time. The resulting analysis is displayed on an interactive map that helps WFP staff, key decision makers and the broader humanitarian community to make more informed and timely decisions relating to food security.\nThe platform covers 94 countries, including countries where WFP has operations as well as most\nlower and lower-middle income countries\n(as classified by the World Bank).\nFor any questions, comments, or if you would like further information, please get in touch by sending an email to\nwfp.mvam@wfp.org\nMethodology\nWFP’s Hunger Monitoring Unit in the Research, Assessment and Monitoring Division conducts real-time food security monitoring to track the latest food security trends. In areas where limited or no data is available, we use machine learning-based predictive models to estimate the food security situation.\nHomepage: Current food consumption\nThe global view of the Hunger Map LIVE immediately visualizes the following data streams:\n1. Prevalence of insufficient food intake at administrative level 1 - is visualized through the colour scheme of greens, yellows and reds\n2. Population density - is visualized through the brightness of a region\nTherefore, the colour indicates the level of food insufficiency in a given country - wherein red signals areas where people are not meeting the required food intake levels and thus require urgent assistance. At the same time, the brightness of a region or country indicates how populated the area is - wherein brighter areas signal the presence of more people.\nMore so, in areas where we do not have data on the prevalence of people with insufficient food intake (1) - and are therefore not clickable - we use the\nProteus index\n, which measures food security in 185 countries over 28 years and is published annually.\n1. Near real-time food security continuous monitoring\nWFP conducts continuous food security monitoring via computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) through call centers. Data is collected on a rolling basis, spread evenly over a past 28/30 calendar days or over a three-month period. The main advantage of this approach is that data is available more frequently and processed daily through automated statistical engines. Daily updates are then produced showing a snapshot of the current food security situation (with a slight time lag of 2-4 days to ensure data quality) over the past 28/30 calendar days.\nCall interviews aim to cover all mobile service providers, and telephone numbers are randomly selected from a database of phone numbers or generated using random-digit dialling (RDD) method. To ensure a more representative sample, WFP uses various types of pre/post-stratification and sampling methods, including by weighting results by population at the first or second administrative level and by a demographic variable such as the level of education or water sources which could impact food security, in order to account for the fact that households with more phones are more likely to be selected (e.g. younger, somewhat better-off households who live in urban areas).\nIn order to compensate for non-response and attrition, key challenges for high frequency mobile phone surveys, new observations are added in each administrative area following the sample design specific for each of the country.\nThe questionnaire includes questions on household demographics, households’ food consumption, coping strategies used (food-based and livelihood-based), access to food, market and health services, and other country-specific livelihood-related questions. In addition, at the end of the survey, respondents are given the opportunity to share additional information on the food situation in their communities.\nThe countries where near-real time data is currently displayed are: Afghanistan, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Syrian Arab Republic, United Republic of Tanzania, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (as of January April 2021).\n2. Predictive analytics\nFor first-level administrative areas where daily updated survey data is not available, the prevalence of people with poor or borderline\nfood consumption\n(FCS) and the prevalence of people with reduced\ncoping strategy index\n(rCSI) ≥19 is estimated with a predictive model.\nPredictive model design:\nTraining data:\nThe models were trained using FCS and rCSI data spanning over 70 countries across, aggregated at the level of first-order administrative divisions. The input variables used to make the predictions were built using information about population density, rainfall, vegetation status, conflict, market prices, macroeconomic indicators, and undernourishment. For areas where past FCS/rCSI measurements are available, the last available data point is also included as input variable.\nData sources:\nBeyond the data sources already credited in the Glossary, additional sources used only for the model but not for display purposes are:\nGridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Count, Revision 11\nWFP’s Alert for Price Spikes (ALPS) indicator\nAlgorithm:\nXGBoost\n– a machine learning technique producing predictive models in the of an ensemble of regression trees. The model parameters were optimized by a cross-validated grid-search.\nModel evaluation:\nThe accuracy of the model was evaluated on a test set comprising 20% of the historical data, having trained 100 models on subsamples (with replacement) of the remaining 80% of the historical data. The following results were obtained on the test sets.\nFCS\nrCSI\nWith past FCS data\nNo past FCS data\nWith past rCSI data\nNo past rCSI data\nCoefficient of determination (R\n2\n)\n0.75\n0.63\n0.78\n0.73\nMean absolute error (MAE)\n0.08\n0.09\n0.06\n0.07\nPredictions:\nThe model produces current estimates of the prevalence of people with poor or borderline FCS and rCSI for areas where no food security data is available; we call this nowcasting. For each first-level administrative boundary we report the median and 95% confidence intervals of a distribution of predictions obtained from 100-bootstrap models trained on subsamples (with replacement) of the training data.\nNext steps:\nMoving forward, more features will be developed and made available to explain how predicted numbers are calculated. In tandem, a technical report on the predictive model will also be made available soon. Additionally, WFP aims to extend the scope of the system’s predictions from nowcasting the\ncurrent\nfood security situation to\nforecasting\nhow the situation is likely to change in the next one, three or six months.\nWhy are the numbers different from last time I checked?\nYou might notice that the figures in the trends of the number of people with insufficient food consumption and of the number of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping might have changed from the last time you accessed the Hunger Map LIVE. These are the reasons why this might have happened.\nWe are constantly looking at improving our predictive model. We regularly re-train the model as new food insecurity data comes in from our near-real time food security continuous monitoring systems and from face-to-face or mVAM surveys carried out by WFP Country Offices. Sometimes we also add new features to the model to improve its accuracy. Overall, any change we make to the model is meant to improve the predictions and make them closer to the truth. For consistency, every time we improve the model, we re-run the predictions for the last 90 days, and this is why you might see numbers changing for dates in the past as well.\nAs we expand our continuous monitoring systems, and as data becomes available for a new country, we switch from showing predictions to showing actual data estimates obtained from daily mVAM surveys. So, when this happens, we replace the historical, prediction-based series of data with the actual, live data being collected daily.\nWe are constantly working to improve our survey aggregation methodology, exploring the best ways to weight the contribution of each household and of each geographical area. As we improve how we compute the aggregates, we apply the new methods across the entire historical series of data, and this may be why the trends may show different numbers sometimes.\nFinally, another reason might be because we obtained updated population estimates from WFP Country Offices. In this case, the existing numbers computed from the predictive models or the continuous monitoring data are recalculated with the new population estimates, causing changes in the number of people with insufficient food consumption and using negative coping strategies.\nSee HungerMap change log"
