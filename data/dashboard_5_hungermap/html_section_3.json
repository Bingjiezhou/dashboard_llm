The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is a proxy of household's food access and a core WFP indicator used to classify households into different groups based on the adequacy of the foods consumed in the week prior to being surveyed. FCS is the most commonly used food security indicator by WFP and partners. This indicator is a composite score based on households’ dietary diversity, food frequency, and relative nutritional importance of different food groups. The FCS is calculated using the frequency of consumption of eight food groups by a household during the 7 days before the survey using standardized weights for each of the food groups reflecting its respective nutrient density, and then classifies households as having ‘poor’, ‘borderline’ or ‘acceptable’ food consumption:\nPoor food consumption:\nTypically refers to households that are not consuming staples and vegetables every day and never or very seldom consume protein-rich food such as meat and dairy (FCS of less than 21 or 28).\nBorderline food consumption:\nTypically refers to households that are consuming staples and vegetables every day, accompanied by oil and pulses a few times a week (FCS of less than 35 or 42).\nAcceptable food consumption:\nTypically refers to households that are consuming staples and vegetables every day, frequently accompanied by oil and pulses, and occasionally meat, fish and dairy (FCS greater than 42).\nSource:\nWorld Food Programme - (i) representative face-to-face household surveys, for example Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA), Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA); and (ii) mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) surveys\nUpdated:\nmVAM surveys: daily or monthly; face-to-face surveys: biannually, annually or when available (varies from country to country)\nIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) / Cadre Harmonisé (CH)\nDeveloped by a global partnership, the IPC/CH is a set of tools and procedures to classify food insecurity. It classifies the populations in five different phases according to the severity of the food insecurity and malnutrition situation: Minimal, Stressed, Crisis, Emergency, and Catastrophe/Famine.\nSource:\nIntegrated Phase Classification (IPC) / Cadre Harmonisé (CH) http://www.ipcinfo.org\nUpdated:\nN/A\nreduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI)\nThe reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI) measures the frequency and severity of the behaviours households engage in when faced with shortages of food or financial resources to buy food. It assesses whether there has been a change in the consumption patterns of a given household. The rCSI is calculated using standard food consumption-based strategies and severity weighting. A higher score indicates that households are employing more frequent and/or extreme negative coping strategies.\nSource:\nWorld Food Programme - (i) representative face-to-face household surveys, for example Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA), Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA); and (ii) mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) surveys\nUpdated:\nmVAM surveys: daily or monthly; face-to-face surveys: biannually, annually or when available (varies from country to country)\nUndernourishment\nUndernourishment is defined as the condition in which an individual’s habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary energy required to maintain a normal, active, healthy life. The indicator is reported as the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU), which is an estimate of the percentage of individuals in the total population that are in a condition of undernourishment. To reduce the influence of possible estimation errors in some of the underlying parameters, national estimates are reported as a three-year moving average.\nSource:\nSource: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 2019.

In children, it can be measured using the weight-for-height nutritional index or mid-upper arm circumference. There are different levels of severity of acute malnutrition: moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM).Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): Also known as severe wasting, SAM is defined by a very low weight for height (below -3z scores of the median WHO child growth standards), or by a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) less than 115 mm or by visible signs of severe wasting, or by the presence of nutritional oedema. Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM): Also known as moderate wasting, MAM is defined by a weight for height between -3 and -2 z-scores of the median WHO child growth standards or by a mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) between 115 mm and 125 mm.\nSource:\nJoint Malnutrition Estimates – UNICEF, WHO, World Bank\nUpdated:\nAnnually or when available\nChronic malnutrition\nAlso known as ‘stunting’, chronic malnutrition is a form of growth failure which develops over a long period of time, as a result of inadequate nutrition over long periods of time (including poor maternal nutrition and poor infant and young child feeding practices) and/or repeated infections. It is defined as the percentage of children, aged 0 to 59 months, who have low height for age. Height for age < -2 standard deviations from the median height for age of reference population = Stunting. Height for age < -3 standard deviations from the median height for age of reference population = Severe stunting.\nSource:\nJoint Malnutrition Estimates – UNICEF, WHO, World Bank\nUpdated:\nAnnually or when available\nMarkets\nImport dependency\nPercentage of a country’s imported food for domestic supply versus its own food production for domestic supply; it is calculated as follows: IDR = Imports/(local production + imports – exports)*100%.\nSource:\nWFP’s calculation based on USDA data\nUpdated:\nDaily\nCurrency exchange\nPrice of a unit of domestic currency in terms of USD.\nSource:\nTrading Economics\nUpdated:\nYearly\nBalance of trade\nThe balance of trade is the value of exports of goods and services less imports of goods and services.

Values below 100% indicate drier than average conditions, above 100% indicate wetter than average conditions. Variations between 90% and 110% are considered as having an inconsequential impact for crops or pasture and these are represented in white. Otherwise, brown shades indicate below-average rainfall and blue shades indicate above-average seasonal rainfall. Users can evaluate whether the season is becoming drier than average (blue shades turning lighter or brown shades getting darker) or wetter than average (brown shades turning lighter or blue shades getting darker).\nSource:\nCHIRPS rainfall estimates, Climate Hazards Group, University of California at Santa Barbara; data processed by WFP VAM\nUpdated:\nEvery 10 days\nVegetation\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer shows the recent vegetation development compared to the average. Green shades show areas where vegetation cover is above average, whilst orange and brown shades identify areas where vegetation cover is below normal. Users can evaluate whether vegetation cover is becoming sparser (lightening greens or darkening oranges) or denser (lightening oranges and darkening greens). Values between 90% and 110% are considered as being within the range of normal variability.\nSource:\nMODIS platforms Terra and Aqua.
